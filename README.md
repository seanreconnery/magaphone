A soundboard app for android made with Python+Kivy.

Love him or hate him, Trump says some wild stuff and it would be foolish NOT to make an app out of 'catchphrases' he has said.
Such classics as, "I'm smart" and "China!" and, of course, "You are Fake News" can be played with the tap of a finger.

Created this to try out Kivy and see if I could make an Android app.
